00:00:00.256 -> 00:00:04.062
Earthling! Thank spacetime you found me!

00:00:04.062 -> 00:00:09.000
Your Captain is stuck here in some sort of interdimensional limbo!

00:00:09.000 -> 00:00:18.000
You see, us groovologists on Planet Fabulon were planning another fabulous party for our beloved Earth this Sunday!

00:00:18:052 -> 00:00:28:06400
And for the occasion, the finest scientific minds of Fabulon have been testing out a brand new way to connect our two planets!

00:00:28:240 -> 00:00:31:112
Interdimensional travel!

00:00:32:000 -> 00:00:41:096
Unfortunately, our interdimensional teleporter may have punched a bunch of holes in the fabric of the universe.

00:00:41:096 -> 00:00:42:251
Our bad!

00:00:42:251 -> 00:00:50:112
We’ve created three rifts into three mysterious dimensions… and they’re inside this very park!

00:00:50:112 -> 00:01:02:144
We need to find these rifts and close them immediately, because we have no idea what - or who - is on the other side.

00:01:02:144 -> 00:01:08:033
Who knows what trouble creatures from other dimensions will bring to our groovy galaxy!!

00:01:08:128 -> 00:01:14:432
And we’ve gotta move fast, cadet; the interdimensional instability is getting worse by the minute.

00:01:14:432 -> 00:01:22:256
I was able to leave a physical marker at the site of each rift before the interference trapped me here in limbo.

00:01:22:256 -> 00:01:25:176
So now it’s up to you!

00:01:25:176 -> 00:01:31:400
Your earth-phone supercomputer has the power to scan for each marker and heal each rift.

00:01:31:402 -> 00:01:36:464
Hot tip: don’t be afraid to alter your perspective as you sleuth them out!

00:01:39:032 -> 00:01:40:320
Ahh! The signal is degrading...

00:01:40:320 -> 00:01:48:080
I will keep transmitting as long as I can, so keep those headphones in your ear holes to hear my instructions!

00:01:48:240 -> 00:01:51:080
Find the markers and you find the rifts.

00:01:51:080 -> 00:01:55:384
Close all three rifts before who knows what dangers get through to Earth…

00:01:55:384 -> 00:01:59:400
and I get trapped in this interdimensional limbo forever!.

00:01:59:400 -> 00:02:02:304
After all, I’ve got a party to throw!

        <div class="persona__desc">
            <div class="persona__summary">Anna is an Italian 27-old immigrant who was born in Milan. She just got Canadian citizenship and is now working as a Visual Merchandiser in Zara. Anna married Jon a few months ago and they are renting a 1-bedroom apartment in Etobicoke.
                <br>
                <br>
                Anna and her husband are dreaming about their own house in Toronto (GTA). Anna is interested in getting a mortgage for buying a house, but she knows only a little about mortgage rules in Canada.
            </div>
            <div class="persona__summary">Anna and her husband have stable income. Anna is also collecting some money for the future in her savings bank account. However, she is not sure if she has enough income to cover the mortgage for a really nice house.
                <br>
                <br>

                Anna doesn’t have any relatives or close friends who had an experience with Canadian mortgage. Therefore, she is scared, that she will not be able to save that much to cover the mortgage. She is planning to have a child, so Anna needs to have her own home to live in and raise a family.

        <div class="persona__desc">
            <div class="persona__summary">George is a 28-year-old residing in Toronto. He graduated from University of Toronto’s business program and is currently working as a business analyst for a bank downtown. He currently lives in a rented 1-bedroom apartment just outside of downtown Toronto.

                <br>
                <br>
                He is looking to invest in a home within the next few years. He is actively looking at the real estate market, observing trends and hotspots. He saves money by living in a rented apartment outside of the downtown area, which he plans to use for his home purchase.
            </div>
            <div class="persona__summary">He handles his own finances, so he is aware of how much he has, how much he can spend, and how much he needs to save. Because of this, he knows he has limitations, but he doesn’t know what those are in terms of bank loans (for the mortgage). He has some experience in home purchasing as he helped his parents with a recent home purchase, but he doesn’t have any experience on his own.
                <br>
                <br>
                He is currently influenced by friends and societal expectations. He sees his peers purchasing homes and starting families, and he feels the need to do the same within the next couple years.

        <div class="persona__type">Neutral Working Class</div>
        <div class="persona__quote">&quot;I don't get it but... Is it really that big of a deal?&quot;</div>
        <div class="persona__desc">
            <div class="persona__summary">Amy is the teenage daughter of a recently immigrated family from central Asia. She was born in Canada, but her parents were not, and because of that they are finding trouble looking for a home.

                <br>
                <br>
                The home Amy’s parents are looking for is their first real home in Canada, only living in apartments before this. As a middle-class family, it’s extremely important that they find a home they can afford.
                <br>
                <br>
                Amy is young and has never really thought about home ownership. What she does know she knows from overhearing her parents. She isn’t particularly interested in the system but her concern for her family means that she wouldn’t object to looking at the information if it caught her eye.

            </div>
            <div class="persona__summary">Amy is still very much an impressionable, young teen who’s influenced by her parents. And in turn, she’s an influence on them. No other everyday sources she would interact with would breach this topic naturally, therefore, everything she knows about their housing status is from her parents.

                <br>
                <br>
                Amy is very neutral on the topic, therefore she has the equal possibility of swinging either way. In a way, she differs from the key demographic is that she’s not the target, but the dependent of the target. She’s not outright affected by the issue but instead, she’s affected by the consequences of it.
